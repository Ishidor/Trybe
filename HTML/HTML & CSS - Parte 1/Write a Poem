    <h1>Elegy for Peter</h1>
    <p>That night we drank warm whiskey<br>   
in our parked car<br>
beyond woods now lost to the suburbs,   <br>
I fell in love with you.<br>
<br>
What waited was the war<br>   
like a bloody curtain,   <br>
and a righteous moment   <br>
when the lovely boy’s<br>
<br>
spine was snapped,<br>
then the long falling into hell.<br>
But lately, you’ve been calling me<br>
back through the years of bitter silence<br>
<br>
to tell me of another river of blood<br>   
and of the highland’s<br>
howl at dusk of human voices<br>   
blasted into ecstasy.<br>
<br>
That night in sweet Lorain<br>   
we drank so long and hard   <br>
we raised ourselves<br>
above the broken places,<br>
<br>
mill fires burning<br>
red against the sky. Why<br>   
is there no end   <br>
to this unraveling.</p>
